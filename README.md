# open-ears
CS4131 final project -shenxy13



The apk can be found in the "release" folder. If you are unable to run the apk, the source code is contained in the "OpenEars" folder.



Note: the image features will not work on API level 29 or higher. Use at your own peril. Minimum required API level is 23. Also, the Chinese UI is recommended as it is (in the opinion of the developer) shorter and more succint than the English counterpart.



Release Version 1.0.3:

​	-I am an idiot who cannot code: electric boogaloo

​	-Patched bug in adding user feature: adding a user to the group now gives them a generated displayName of their UID (as was intended), rather than the UID of the person who added them

​	-Kidnapped your family



Release Version 1.0.2:

​	-I am an idiot who cannot code

​	-Patched a major bug in how contribution is calculated, upvoting on a post no longer resets user contribution to 0

​	-Patched a minor bug in the UI

​	-Kidnapped your family



Release Version 1.0.1:

​	-I get it, I get it, I get it. My taste in colour is horrible. I've fixed it somewhat. Now please find some other bug to complain about.

​	-(Please don't, I probably won't have time to fix it)

​	-Kidnapped your family



Release Version 1.0.0:

​	-App should (hopefully) be working correctly

​	-Your family will be kidnapped if you have dissenting opinions with the owner of the "Open Ears" organisation
